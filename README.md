# Aion Miner

### About
Welcome to the Aion mining repository, this repository will contain documentation, mining details and reference implementations of CPU and CUDA miners for the Aion blockchain. 

### Algorithm Details

Aion leverages an enhanced Equihash algorithm for its Proof of Work (PoW). Details regarding changes to the algorithm may be found in the in [wiki](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_miner/wiki/Aion-equihash_210_9--specification-and-migration-guide.).

### Reference Miners

In addition to providing a miner within the Aion kernel, two reference miners (CPU, GPU-CUDA) and a solo mining pool have been provided. 

The solo mining pool may be found [here](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_miner/tree/master/aion_solo_pool).

The reference mining clients may be found [here](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_miner/tree/master/aion_reference_miner).

Additionally, recompiled releases for both the mining pool as well as mining clients may be found under the [releases](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_miner/releases) page as they become available.
